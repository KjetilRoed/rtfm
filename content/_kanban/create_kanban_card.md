## How to directly create a Kanban Card?

There are a few possible ways to directly create a card on your board:

### Right click
Right-click with your mouse on the area of the board (section: column and swimlane) where you want the new card to be created. Usually, this is the "Backlog" or the "Request" column. Click on the “+” icon to open a new Kanban card.

When the import panel pops up → review the sample files (**See sample files**) and then structure your Excel file accordingly. Pay attention to the notes provided at the bottom of the panel in order to be aware of the allowed import fields and date formats.
**Note: The only mandatory field is the Title of the card.**

Create your Excel file as per the requirements and click the Browse button to select the: xls or xlsx file for importing.

The file will be scanned for compatibility. The presence of a red column signalizes that the field is not recognized by the system and will be ignored during the import procedure.

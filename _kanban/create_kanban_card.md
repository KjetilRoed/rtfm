## How to directly create a Kanban Card?

There are a few possible ways to directly create a card on your board:

1. Right-click with your mouse on the area of the board (section: column and swimlane) where you want the new card to be created. Usually, this is the "Backlog" or the "Request" column. Click on the “+” icon to open a new Kanban card.

Fill in the information relevant to the task (e.g. title; priority; assignee, create subtasks relevant to the task, etc.) and select " Add Card" on the bottom right corner of the card to create it.

## Create cards over email
By setting up the Kanbanize email integration, you can create a card on the board via email. The email integration feature hooks your inbox to а Kanban board of your choice. All you need to do is to send an email to your integrated email with Kanbanize – the Subject* of the email defines the name of the board where the card is to be created and the card title, while the email Body** is used to define the card parameters such as: assignee, column, priority, etc.

* SUBJECT: The name of the board where the card is to be created should be present surrounded by curly brackets. For example: {boardname} This is Title
** BODY: You can set the parameters when creating a card, following the format: {#assignee: name} or {#column: name}
